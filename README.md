# dataVR
# this project was a hack from Arch Hacks, this fall. My team and I designed an application that would allow the user to plot data for 
# visualization in 3 space, using a virtual reality headset. 
# The project was built using C# and JavaScript within Unity3D, with an Oculus Rift. 
# To run, open in unity3D, and press play. 
# Unfortunately, the creation of dynamic spheres is currently under work, to fully appreciate the project, I will need to work with my
# team to fix it. 
# Our hope is that this technology will create new ways to visualize big data sets.
